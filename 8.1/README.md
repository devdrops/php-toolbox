## Important Notes For This Version

**Regarding PHPLOC**. Since January 2023, Sebastian Bergmann decided to archive the repository. So, I won't keep it to
avoid breaking changes as new fixes on PHP may cause problems that will not be fixed.

**Regarding OPCache**. I've added the necessary settings to enable the usage of OPCache, which can speed up the usage of
Psalm (along with PHP's new JIT resources). You can check these settings at [opcache.ini](./opcache.ini).

By default, the checking for timestamps is disabled. You have to enable it by passing an environment variable,
`PHP_OPCACHE_VALIDATE_TIMESTAMPS=1`, to Docker's running environment.

**Regarding Psalm**. Psalm requires a configuration XML file. You can use your own, create a new one (by running `psalm
--init`) or use a sample file I've added to the image. You can check it at [psalm.xml](./psalm.xml). IN the image, this
file is located at `/code/psalm/`.

To use this sample file, run any Psalm command as `psalm -c /config/psalm/psalm.xml`.
